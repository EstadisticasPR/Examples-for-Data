# The open source software R is used to obtain
# the percentage of people that have asthma by gender and by the category of
# age using the data from data.pr.gov which contains information of the  
# 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System' (BFRSS) survey for the year 2012.
# R or RStudio can be downloaded from:
# https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ or https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/
# This code runs in R 3.3.1 since October 30, 2016, In case of error,
# verify your version of the data R, or packages since posible changes might have occured.

# NOTE: Each line that starts with "#" R detects as a comment

# First, the required tools are prepared to work in the case study.

# A function to install or load required packages for this application will be created. The function is provided at: https://gist.github.com/stevenworthington/3178163
