# The open source software R is used to 
# analyze the frequency of different disciplinary incidents reported in  
# the public schools of Puerto Rico for the year 2013-2014
# using the available data at data.pr.gov and a word cloud as a visual tool 
# 
#
# R or RStudio for Windows can be downloaded from 
# https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ o https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/
# This code runs in R 3.3.1 since December, 2016. In case of error,
# verify your version of the data R, or packages since posible changes might have occured.

# First, the required tools are prepared to work in the case study
