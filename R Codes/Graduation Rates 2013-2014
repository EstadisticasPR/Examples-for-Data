# The open source software R is used to answer the following questions
# 1. Are graduation rates of public high schools different by gender?
# 2. Are graduation rates of students below the poverty level different in some districts?
# Data from portal.data.pr.gov is used; which contains the graduation rate
# of public high schools of Puerto Rico during the academic year of 2013-14
# 
# R or RStudio can be downloaded from:
# https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ or https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/
# This code runs in R 3.3.1 since October 30, 2016. In case of error,
# verify your version of the data R, or packages since posible changes might have occured.
