# We used the free program of analytical statistics called R to obtain the murder rate in some 
# regions of Puerto Rico. R o R Studio for Windows can be downloaded in
# https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ or https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/. 
# Note that in addition to the criminality data we need the data for the police department 
# population of Puerto Rico per region during those years for us to calculate the homicide 
# statistics in Puerto Rico for 2015.

# NOTE: Every line that begins with “#” the program detects it as a comment.

# First, prepare the necessary tools to work on the example.
install.packages("data.table") # Install all of the components that we need to work on the example.
library(data.table) # Upload the library “data.table” to the R program
d.ic=fread("https://data.pr.gov/api/views/pzaz-tkx9/rows.csv") # Upload the crime incidences to the R program. 
d.demo=fread("https://www.indicadores.pr/api/views/5pce-675z/rows.csv") # Upload the demographic data base to the R program.

# With the “colnames” function we changed the name of each variable in the data base that we just 
# uploaded. This is a very important step, since some of the characters do not upload as they should.
